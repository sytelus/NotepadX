<H1>Why This Program Exist</H1>
<p>
Since quite a few years, I'd been managing little pieces of texts in simple files using Notepad. This usually included all kind of things ranging from collegues phone numbers or quotes or news bits or an website links and so on. Soon I realized by the amount of information I had collected was needed to put in organized fashion in categories. So I looked for a program that allows me to create categories and put my notes inside it. 
<br><br>
I did found a good one called NoteKeeper which I used for about an year until I exausted its capasity and feature set. I needed better program which is more advanced, had more features and even more importantly it needs to be Open Source, i.e., something I can twist and turn for my own requirements. 
<br><br>
Creating a software is costly process and as a rule I would not invest my own time if someone has already done it. But after lots of searches I didn't found anything that would match my requirements. On the otherhand, managing my notes is still an important thing and its value itself outweighes the cost of creating such program. So I decided tro step in to this endever in around early 2003. However to keep my "investment" minimum, I decided to create reusable application parts which I can plugin in to other stuff I'm doing and hence save my time in those stuff. This way, CatNotes (which was the original name of this program) was just mere a "Demo" for reusable parts I created.
<br><br>
NotepadX was in my own extensive solo use almost all of 2003. So it has been tested, evolved and redisigned many times by myself over an year. I delayed it's public distribution all this time mostly because of pure lazyness. But recenly I showed it to my wife and I realized it could have been used by many more while it's still being evolved. So while she is in Hong Kong, I just polished it up and decided to go live!
