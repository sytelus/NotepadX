<H1>Worksheet and Hierarchy Notes</H1>
<p>
Apart from simple notes where you just want to type in and formate your typings like in Word, the NotepadX also allows you to create Worksheet type of notes. The Worksheet type of notes are like Excel where you can type in table. However it's not really Excel. You can't do formulas and other fency stuff but just storing your data in tabular format.

The other type of note that NotepadX allows you to create is Hierarchy type of notes. Here you can create hierarchy. For example, you can create a family tree, decision tree and so on. You can even do drag and drop anywhere you like!
