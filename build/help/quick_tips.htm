Sometime you want to put a password for a note. So if anyone tries to open it, he or she would be asked for a password. Use Edit > Make Note Secure menu for this. Remember, if you forget the password, there's no going back. NotepadX doesn't save your password to get it back. It uses strong encryption that comes with Microsoft .Net Framework so it's very difficult to access the content, if not impossible, unless you have password
