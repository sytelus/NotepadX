<H1>For Programmers</H1>
<p>
This program was created with Microsoft Visual Studio.Net and Microsoft .Net Framework 1.1. The code is written in C# and most of it is written in highly reusable fashion. Several code snippets including the one for MRU, Property Grid, application settings, previous instance check, command line parsing and so on were obtained from various articles and websites. I'm giving away entire source code for free for you to use in the same way and have tried to credit appropriate authors where I can. 
<br><br>
NotepadX supports few command line parameters which can be seen by passing /?.
<br><br>
NotepadX is designed to support many more types of notes apart from existing ones for Worksheet and Hierarchy types.
